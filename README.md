# Web SNAP UI
Thank you for visiting a demo page for the Web IFPUG SNAP UI Calculator!

IFPUG SNAP is a method for measuring non-functional size of software applications. We are trying to build a tool that will support specialists in measuring the size of non-functional requirements related to user interfaces (UI). The size of UI-related requirements (SNAP Category 2.1) is measured per elementary process by analyzing a set of screens involved in the function. A measurement specialist has to identify all unique UI Elements types (e.g., text boxes, combo boxes) and their properties that need to be configured to meet non-functional requirements. The tool uses a set of customizable rules to analyze a set of web pages for an elementary process to find potential UI Elements and UI Properties.

We would like to ask you for help in assessing the potential usefulness of the tool for practitioners. Imagine that your team added a new functionality to your web application and now you would like to understand what UI Elements and Properties has been configured to calculate SP for the category 2.1. The reports you are going to see were generated using the prototype tool. Keep in mind that the tool can be configured by providing rules for identifying UI Elements and UI Properties, however, you will see only the results for some default configurations prepared by us. Please feel free to play with the reports. We would be grateful if you devote few minutes of your time to answer the survey afterward (the link is available in the upper menu):
